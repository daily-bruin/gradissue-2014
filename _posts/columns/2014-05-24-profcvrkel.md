No one falls into philosophy. It’s not a default career choice.

Philosophy is typically not taught in grades K-12, and I don’t know many kids who dream of becoming philosophers when they grow up (though I think we should do some PR on this).

My discipline has a reputation – sometimes deserved – for meaningless navel gazing, and I think all philosophers have lived through the exquisite awkwardness of trying to explain our work at cocktail parties. So I’m going to wager that the majority of philosophers have an origin story, some series of events that led us down this path. This is mine.

I was always an eccentric kid, lost in works of fiction. But fiction bothered me sometimes. When I was 5, my mom found me in a full-blown, hyperventilating, tears-streaming-down-my-red-face panic attack. Between sobs, I asked her, “But what if we’re the characters in someone else’s book? What if we’re not even real people?” My mom gave me a Tums and put me down for a nap (I was not the world’s easiest kid to parent).

But when I turned 12, reality no longer seemed indistinguishable from fiction. That year, one of my good friends committed suicide. There was no ambiguity to this event. He used a gun. He left a note. And it shattered my community. It shattered me. 

His parents were deeply religious, and suicide was strictly forbidden in their faith. And so, I found myself sitting in a memorial service in a church, listening to people memorialize him as a relentlessly sunny kid who was the victim of a senseless mishap. I didn’t recognize the boy they were talking about.

I sat on the hard wooden pew, physically overwhelmed with the complexity of my own emotions. This is the first time in my life I can recall feeling fury. At that moment, the fury seemed directed at his parents. It seemed disrespectful to paint a picture of my friend that didn’t at all reflect who he was in life, or the choices he made. Like the real him wasn’t worth talking about or mourning over.

But that fury was coupled with other emotions. I saw his parents at the front of the church, both of them physically broken with grief. His mother could barely speak. I understood why we were all pretending here. Part of me wanted to pretend too.

After the service, everyone got up to pay their respects to his parents. I sat in my pew, entirely unsure of what to do. Should I pay my respects to the people who just turned my friend’s memorial service into a work of fiction? Should I go give them a hug and tell them how happy he would have been? Would I be wronging the memory of my friend, disrespecting him, if I played along? And who was I to talk? I knew my friend well – should I have foreseen his suicide? Did any of this even matter?

People talk about philosophy as if it is utterly divorced from the real world, unconnected from practical concerns. I became a philosopher because I am relentlessly worried about the real world. In that moment, sitting in that church, I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know what I owed my friend's parents or my friend. And I didn’t know how I should feel about myself.

I thought, people must have answers to these questions, even if the answer is that there are no answers. And so they had. That week, I read my first ethics (a subfield of philosophy) text. I never stopped.

Ethicists like me are often painted as prudish moral judges, trying to keep track of everyone’s misdeeds in our ledger. I can’t speak for everyone in my discipline, but I can’t be bothered keeping track of everyone else. I am just trying to decide what I should do on this side of the fence.

I became an ethicist because I recognize that all of us act for reasons, and not thinking about those reasons doesn’t make them go away. If everything we do is for reasons, I want to pick good ones. And at its core, my work is about figuring out what those good reasons look like.

These days I work primarily in bioethics, helping clinicians and scientists figure out how to navigate the minefields in their disciplines. I do it because working with emerging technologies and patients is messy and hard, and my discipline has tools to help.

I do it because philosophy improves every decision I make, every single day. I do it because I think there’s not much that matters more.
