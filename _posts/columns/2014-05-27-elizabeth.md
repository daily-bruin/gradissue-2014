This is weird. Writing this column after my own -30- has come and gone. I already did this, I already ran my hands along the cool brick of the physics building where I spent countless hours scribbling and tinkering, already scrunched my bare feet in the Daily Bruin’s green carpet at 2 a.m., uploading the paper for the campus to read in the morning. Already packed my bags. Already left.

Already restarted.

I wiped the sweat from my brow, finished my degree 10 weeks ago. Ten weeks has granted me shit wisdom. I’m just where y’all are standing, still looking down at my feet, then up and out, wide-eyed. I have a steady job, I’m doing journalism, I made it! And yet.

You know that moment everyone has in college, when standing in ratty ladybug pajama shorts in a whitewashed kitchen, and you realize you can have peanut butter on burnt tortillas for dinner again and no one is watching?

I know I’m late figuring out my freedom, but these moments happen to me every day. I can nail shelves to my wall! I do my laundry every day or drive a couple of hours to have dinner with my parents or camp all weekend. I grow squash in my front yard.

I could lay down roots if I wanted to: I could stay here forever.

And every morning the future tumbles out in front of you. And you could just leave it all behind too, climb in your car, on your bike, on the train, and glance back just once to acknowledge you’re leaving. No one is watching. Everything tastes new. Whatever structure you think there is after college, you have to build it.

So to wrap this up, you know what the Daily Bruin taught me? It taught me this: If you’ve got the chops and the gumption, you’re going to get what you ask for. So ask often, ask big.

I don’t mean ask for permission. I mean ask for things you can’t get on your own and you don’t think anyone will give you.

I did in my last months at school, and I do in my new job in Davis, and I’m always surprised because people almost always say yes. To a funded reporting trip to Mexico. To my own science podcast. To meet for lunch. To a camping spot at 8 p.m. on Saturday on a full Memorial Day weekend. To speak on a media panel in Washington, D.C.

My best advice, for what it’s worth: Be shameless. Be shameless and kind and hardworking and brave.

You’re only going to get what you ask for.
