One day I’ll trade my pen for a scalpel, but I think I’ll always appreciate the beauty and precision of an effective first sentence.

I long considered the Daily Bruin my greatest indulgence. Every hour I spent in the office, every pen I misplaced in the act of reporting, was a guilty excess – a hobby I chose to pursue because I loved it, but not because I should.

I spent countless nights wondering when I should pull the plug and do what a traditional pre-medical student should be doing. When was enough, enough? Was it when I was writing three stories a week? Or was it when I seemed to be spending 10 hours a day in the office?

But reporting became an addiction. Four years later, I can tell you there is nothing more satisfying than finding the words to share a story you think is important. There is nothing more enticing than the hunt for your next feature tucked away somewhere on campus. And there is nothing more humbling than listening.

It’s funny, really, because you actually learn quite a bit about yourself when you spend your days writing about other people.

I learned that politics, even if ridiculous, are important – thanks, USAC. I learned the best stories involve collaboration across disciplines. And I remembered that apathy is something we cannot afford. Even when all I could offer was an open ear and a couple of inches in print, writing features was an investment in the lives of others.

Now I understand that I stayed because somehow breathing in the dusty air of this dingy office made me walk lighter. I felt like a better person, and I didn’t want to give that up. I have the rest of my life to dedicate myself to medicine, but this was my chance to be a journalist. And if I’m any good at being a doctor in the years to come, I know it’s in part because I stopped to smell the newspapers.

The truth is, the Daily Bruin has always been just as much for us as it is for our readers, and that’s because we leave a trace of ourselves in every line of copy. Looking back, I see myself most clearly in my first sentences, known in the newsroom as ledes.

Read me the first sentence of any feature I’ve written, and my reporting experience will rush back. I may never have another byline, but I’ll remember my favorite stories and my time at The Bruin by the ledes I’ve written.

Sometimes it’s the weather that stands out in my memory: It was a sunny Friday as I rushed down to the Kinross Building South, sweating, to write my first story as Science and Health editor on book preservation. I thought of the lede as I passed by the medical center on the way back up to the apartments.

Other times it’s the distractions I remember the most: When I wrote my geocaching story I was sitting on the floor of my Rieber Hall dorm. Students were playing catch in the hallway, and I had a midterm the next day. My idea for the lede came from looking at my "Goonies" poster. It’s still the most effortless story I’ve written.

Ironically, though, my favorite lede was never published: “In the small, white wooden courthouse cornfields away from the bloodiest battles of the war, the soiled blue wool uniform met the fresh cotton gray to bring a country together again.”

Scrawled in a reporter's notebook more than two years ago during a writing workshop, it describes, with creative license, the surrender of Robert E. Lee to Ulysses S. Grant on April 9, 1865.

I saved it for the reenactment story I swore I would one day write.

Two and a half years later and still no story, but even unpublished ledes carry nostalgia. And that’s good enough for me.

Now I’ve run out of time, and there are no ledes left for me to write.

All there is to say is that when I walked through the double doors of the Daily Bruin four years ago asking for the campus tours, I never thought Kerckhoff Hall would come to mean so much to me.

My experience at the university, it seems, started where it would one day end – in the windowless office between North and South Campus where my competing interests found a way to complement each other.

For all the ledes I wrote and read in between, I’m grateful.
