This is my story.

Unlike many of my fellow Daily Bruin graduates, I joined The Bruin during the fall of my third year at UCLA.

Although I had planned on joining The Bruin during the fall of my first year, I did not submit my application. Having designed for my high school newspaper, I figured that the natural progression would be to work for my college newspaper. However, I wanted to try something new now that I was in college. So, instead, I joined UCLA Wushu, where I learned different styles of Chinese martial arts, competed in multiple tournaments throughout California, endured multiple cuts and wounds from swords and other weapons, serendipitously landed the cover of UCLA Magazine and joined my first UCLA “family.”

After two years of devoting the majority of my time and energy to my classes and to wushu, I decided that it was time for me, once again, to move on to something new. This time, I decided to submit my application to the Daily Bruin in hopes of meeting new people and improving my design abilities.

After being accepted as a design intern, I tried to juggle both my wushu training and my work at The Bruin. But I soon realized that I would have to choose one.

I chose the Daily Bruin.

Working as a design contributor during my third year at UCLA, I fell in love with the windowless newsroom, including the random piles of old newspapers and the slow-as-fudge computers. Most of all, I enjoyed being around my fellow staff members as we tirelessly worked toward a single goal each day – to make a paper.

After becoming an assistant design director and cross-training in the photography department during my final year, I felt fully integrated into the Daily Bruin “family.” I designed some amazing pages and got to take some awesome photos. In essence, I more than accomplished the two goals that I set for myself when I joined The Bruin.

Having now worked at The Bruin for two years, I know that I will never forget the headaches I would get after spending more than six hours at a time in the newsroom, the endless debates over what “defines” a sandwich (is it the bread or what is between the bread?), the countless trips to Panda Express or Chick-fil-A for a quick meal, the one night where I had to drive to Home Depot to buy a stool so that I could be tall enough to take pictures of Liam Neeson at a red-carpet premiere, the proper spelling of “forward,” the numerous discussions over the future of the "Fast & Furious" franchise and the lifelong friends that I have met and worked with along the way.

Looking back on my four years at UCLA, I do not regret my choice to join The Bruin during my third year, nor my choice to pursue different extracurriculars during my first year. Because of these choices, I was able to meet the amazing people of both UCLA Wushu and the Daily Bruin. I was also able to try something completely new and to gain more experience in a previously learned ability, as well as becoming more confident in myself and a better leader.

Although it may seem like I’m saying “goodbye forever” to both of my families at UCLA, I’m not. In the words of Vin Diesel in "Fast & Furious 6," “You don’t turn your back on family.”
