UCLA asks much of its students. We look to you not only to be outstanding scholars, but also to embrace your roles as volunteers, engaged citizens, mentors and leaders. We encourage you to envision your dreams and to stride toward them. In concert with UCLA’s mission as a great public university, we challenge you to consider how your unique talents can improve the world around us.

Like others before you, the Class of 2014 has met and exceeded those ambitious expectations. On the occasion of your commencement, I am delighted to congratulate you for reaching this magnificent milestone and for living up to those lofty standards.

Among our newest graduates, many overcame substantial obstacles just to become Bruins. Many of you benefitted greatly from the generosity of loved ones who supported your education; and many more from the indispensable philanthropy of our alumni and friends whose contributions to UCLA fund scholarships and fellowships.

But whatever your personal journey to UCLA, each of you has grown and each of you has given of yourself. You have done so among thousands of other exceptionally bright men and women. Together, you have formed a community that makes us proud: A community built on mutual respect, and a community that celebrates our varied backgrounds even as we come together to pursue excellence in all we do. You have also taken advantage of the opportunity to study in a city that is, in so many ways, a laboratory for understanding 21st-century America. It’s that aspect of Los Angeles that has made it an ideal proving ground for your community-based research and for our campus’s first Grand Challenge project, which aimed for our city to use only renewable energy and local water by 2050.

During your time here, you have forged friendships that will be among your most important relationships for years to come. I hope you will treasure them in your personal and professional lives, and carry them as lasting evidence of what makes UCLA such a special place. Always know that UCLA is yours and you have a home here.

By participating in UCLA Volunteer Day and a host of other civic engagement initiatives, you have embraced the values that define our unique academic environment, and you have forever enriched our UCLA legacy. This is no small feat when you consider the Bruins who came before you: trailblazers and innovators in nearly every field imaginable, the most audacious thinkers and the most accomplished doers. Based on what you have accomplished here, in this demanding environment, I am confident that you will equal and even surpass their achievements – and that you will build upon their contributions to our greater good.

This commencement season follows the public launch of our Centennial Campaign for UCLA, which will strengthen our campus’s financial self-reliance as we approach 2019, the 100th anniversary of our founding. UCLA is unique among the world’s great institutions of higher education; no other university has done so much to advance knowledge and enhance quality of life in such a short period of time. The beginning of the $4.2 billion fundraising effort has inspired us not only to celebrate our extraordinary progress and the victories we have won, but also to imagine and plan for a future filled with extraordinary new possibilities.

I hope your graduation will inspire you to do the same: to reflect on the remarkable success of your time at UCLA, to take stock in your own self-reliance and to prepare yourself for a future filled with immense promise.
