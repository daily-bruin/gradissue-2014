<p>“Eitan Arom knows nothing about racial struggle, right? He went to Beverly Hills High. If that does not say PRIVILEGE, what does?”</p>

<p>That’s a comment on a column of mine from October 2012, by a person who identified himself online as Jason Smith. There was an emoticon at the end, which I left out because I didn’t know how to put a quotation mark after it, but it looked like this:</p>

<p>:-/ ­</p>

<p>As I mentally account for my college experience with nostalgia, appreciation and generally a lot of feels, I realize for some people, that column will be my lasting legacy at UCLA.</p>

<p>And in a way, it is. Having stared down faceless armies of online hecklers, I can say that learning to criticize your surroundings and yourself is one of most important things college can teach you.</p>

<p>Daily Bruin readers rarely failed to criticize me, some with reason, others with anger and a few with genuinely hurt feelings.</p>

<p>That particular column touched a nerve for a lot of people. It called on UCLA to review an admissions system that reportedly violated the state’s affirmative action policy. But it seemed, at least in one poorly worded sentence, to call for fewer black and Latino student on campus.</p>

<p>It evoked a bitter response.</p>

<p>In other words, it made a lot of people feel like this:</p>

<p>:-/</p>

<p>And I’m sorry for that. At the risk of sounding repetitive, there’s no reason to upset people for no reason, and I may have done that. But at other times, in the service of asking hard questions and disinfecting our collective wounds, it is natural and even desirable to make people upset.</p>

<p>At all times, it is key to treat institutions with suspicion and people with empathy. Doing the first without the second can get you in a good deal of trouble, as I found out.</p>

<p>What my nightmare, protest-inciting, trauma-inducing, community-embittering column tried to do was criticize institutions – in particular, UCLA. That’s what I tried to do in most of my columns, directing my scrutiny towards both UCLA-proper and the other institutions we are surrounded by as students: the student government, the Associated Students UCLA, the campus administration and the UCLA Health System, to name a few.</p>

<p>I firmly believe that if you love an institution, you should criticize it.</p>

<p>College is supposed to teach you to be critical. Undoubtedly, the Daily Bruin did that for me.</p>

<p>I’ll pause here to offer a disclaimer: I think asking graduating college students to give advice is a somewhat silly pursuit. We’re far too deeply enveloped in a cloud of nostalgia and existential panic to come up with anything coherent and smart to say.</p>

<p>But I’m still going to pretend as if you, the reader of this column, had asked me to give a piece of advice and I’m going state one.</p>

<p>Figure out how to ask the right questions and ask them. Ask them until you get an answer that withstands further questioning, and then treat that answer with unease. In particular, ask questions to yourself and about yourself.</p>

<p>Jason Smith made me ask if Eitan Arom, a white, upper middle-class kid with a vocabulary full of $10 words can think critically about important issues like race and education.</p>

<p>Well, I sure hope so. If the answer to that question is ‘no,’ I might as well quit while I’m ahead, move back in with my parents and develop a drug problem with their trust money. But I don’t plan to.</p>

<p>So I’m sorry if I ever made you feel like this:</p>

<p>:-/</p>

<p>Just know I was trying, like most of us, to do a service for the university.</p>

<p>To question.</p>

<p>To use in good faith my twenty-seven-thousandth of the power, prestige and energy we undergraduates bring here. To use it with understanding, humility and open-mindedness. To transform this place, just a little and for the better.</p>

<p>Thanks to everybody who helped me do it, and who kept me massively entertained and feeling at home while I did.</p>

<p><em>Arom was the opinion editor from 2013-2014, and news contributor and columnist from 2012-2013.</em></p>
