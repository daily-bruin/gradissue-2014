<p>I have been composing this senior column in my head since I first heard of it my freshman year. But when I sat down to finally write, all these trite truisms started flowing. I felt like I was composing a crappy commencement speech.</p>

<p>So I went back and read the columns of years past for inspiration. I thought I would write about Daily Bruin camaraderie, the long days and nights spent together munching on empty calories, staring at computer screens and getting to know how people tick. You learn a lot about your friends when you work side by side with them in a hellishly hot, windowless office.</p>

<p>The newsroom is, as a writer for The Awl, one of my favorite online magazines, aptly put it, a “clubhouse run by flighty, inexperienced, earnest kids who were behind on their homework.”</p>

<p>Correction: earnest kids who never did their homework.</p>

<p>But every column I read mentioned the “lifelong friends” made in the office, how it serves as a kind of second home on campus and helps people find their niche at UCLA.</p>

<p>So, for a while, I considered writing about the challenges of journalism today. But I am tired of hearing about the challenges, and I still do not feel like I can offer any solutions. All I can say is that we are trying. And that, to me at least, spending all day producing a print paper often felt like trying to resuscitate a dinosaur.</p>

<p>Rather than write about the obvious, I want to use this space to write what I feel is necessary. For me, the hardest part of journalism is not choosing what to put in the story, but rather what to leave out. So I will leave out the truisms, and share some things I still do not understand, even four years later.</p>

<p>I still do not understand why some people trust us with their most intimate stories, and I am still learning how to handle the weight of telling those stories.</p>

<p>A month ago, after spending nearly 14 hours in our office finishing an investigative series on sexual assault at UCLA, I returned home at 2 a.m. and let myself fall face first onto the cushions of my couch.</p>

<p>It had been a rough few months.</p>

<p>The relief of finishing that story hit me all at once. The tears started to flow, and soon I was doing the full-on “ugly cry.” Before bed, I opened up my iPhone notes app.</p>

<p>Empathy is a journalist’s greatest strength and greatest flaw, I typed.</p>

<p>Looking back, it’s just another truism. But at the time, it felt so revelatory to finally understand the full weight of telling a story after four years of “doing journalism.”</p>

<p>One morning a few months earlier, my roommate had asked me why I was continually locking our bedroom door before bed. Even though most of the survivors I interviewed were raped by acquaintances, I realized I had become afraid of the world. I was angry that sexual violence was so prevalent and haunted by these stories of loss and trauma.</p>

<p>I began to resent the fact that it felt so necessary to write that story.</p>

<p>Success in journalism sometimes feels like profiting off of someone else’s failures and miseries. This is another thing I still do not understand. My freshman year, I wrote a story about a woman who recorded a YouTube video ranting about Asians in the library. The clip went viral. She received death threats. I eventually won an award for the story. Her academic career was ruined and mine was just beginning.</p>

<p>None of it felt fair. I still find those realities hard to reconcile.</p>

<p>To everyone I’ve spoken to during the past four years, I carry your stories in my heart. Your fears, your nightmares, your successes and most importantly, your bravery. To our readers, I can only hope that our journalism allowed you to carry a piece of someone else’s story in your heart for a little while. I hope reading others’ stories enraged you, enlightened you and most importantly, left you feeling exquisitely and completely human. I hope some stories lifted you up. I hope you kept reading the ones that felt too heavy.</p>

<p>I wish I had more space to write about the immense bravery of those six individuals who spoke to me for the story on sexual assault. How they refused to be defined by what happened to them. How they relived trauma because they felt it was important to tell their story in the hopes that it might change someone else’s story one day. They taught me how to free yourself of what haunts you, to write truths instead of truisms.</p>

<p>At the end of it all, I’m only just beginning to understand.</p>
