<p>I’ll be the first one to admit it – I haven’t done a damn thing for the Daily Bruin recently. I’ve taken very few photos, pitched zero story ideas, rarely spent any time in the office and missed meetings. You can count the number of contributions I’ve made to the paper in the past quarter on one hand, even if you’re missing a finger or two.</p>

<p>Before you label me a slacker, though, let me tell you that it was not always this way. There was a time when I would eat, drink and breathe the Daily Bruin, and that time wasn’t very long ago. I served as an assistant photo editor from 2011 to 2012, and that was the main thing I did that school year. I’m proud to say that I did it well.</p>

<p>I loved it, but I hated it, and it wore on me. School took a backseat, and I wasn’t sure if that was a good thing. I watched many of my peers continue on that same arc, using their time at the Daily Bruin as a springboard for careers in journalism. I was proud of them, and I considered trying to do something similar. But I decided that wasn’t for me.</p>

<p>So I moved on. I made school my priority again and kept an eye on the post-graduation horizon. I developed interests, picked up a minor, traveled, gained work experiences, wrote a thesis, got a job. I broadened my worldview, then hardened it. I was getting a degree and thinking about a career.</p>

<p>It’s all over now, so it’s time for nostalgia and hindsight. I’m excited about the future and happy with the choices I made to get myself here, including the choice to move away from journalism. Focusing my energy on my academics and career development during the last few years was one of the best decisions I made at UCLA.</p>

<p>The single best decision, though, was joining The Bruin in the first place. I have been reflecting recently on whether my time at UCLA has prepared me for the real world, and I’m just now realizing how much of my education took place in Kerckhoff 118. I learned here what it means to honor a commitment – to stick it out for myself, for others and for something larger than any of us. I learned how to do a job responsibly but creatively. I learned how to be a leader who can identify and cultivate talent in people. I learned how to be good at something and to enjoy the satisfaction that comes with that.</p>

<p>Then there are the friendships. What tighter community is there than one made up of 20-somethings who work together five days a week to create something they’re tremendously proud of? We all have no choice but to remain lifelong friends.</p>

<p>And of course there are the memories. Photographing a football game in a snowstorm. Walking to the podium with my fellow photo editors two years ago to accept the “Best Section” award, one of the most satisfying moments of my life. Standing amid euphoria as the UCLA women’s soccer team celebrated a miracle semifinal comeback in December, listening to Ellie Goulding’s “Anything Could Happen” and knowing that school championship number 110 was on the way. Being thrown into a completely spontaneous volleyball game with a colleague, four sources and six random guys while on assignment in a small Mexican fishing village. Photographing March Madness, my single favorite sporting event.</p>

<p>To anyone who wants to be part of the Daily Bruin and plans on pursuing a career outside of journalism, let me be the first to tell you this: It will help you get there. It will prepare you more than you can imagine.</p>

<p>There may be a time to step back eventually, but you’ll know when that is, and you’ll handle it well. You’ll move on to the next thing, but you’ll take memories, lifelong relationships and a pretty underrated workplace education along with you. You might have a few regrets, but you’ll know you did well.</p>

<p>Trust me, I’m speaking from experience.</p>
