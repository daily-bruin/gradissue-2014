<p>One day I’ll trade my pen for a scalpel, but I think I’ll always appreciate the beauty and precision of an effective first sentence.</p>

<p>I long considered the Daily Bruin my greatest indulgence. Every hour I spent in the office, every pen I misplaced in the act of reporting, was a guilty excess – a hobby I chose to pursue because I loved it, but not because I should.</p>

<p>I spent countless nights wondering when I should pull the plug and do what a traditional pre-medical student should be doing. When was enough, enough? Was it when I was writing three stories a week? Or was it when I seemed to be spending 10 hours a day in the office?</p>

<p>But reporting became an addiction. Four years later, I can tell you there is nothing more satisfying than finding the words to share a story you think is important. There is nothing more enticing than the hunt for your next feature tucked away somewhere on campus. And there is nothing more humbling than listening.</p>

<p>It’s funny, really, because you actually learn quite a bit about yourself when you spend your days writing about other people.</p>

<p>I learned that politics, even if ridiculous, are important – thanks, USAC. I learned the best stories involve collaboration across disciplines. And I remembered that apathy is something we cannot afford. Even when all I could offer was an open ear and a couple of inches in print, writing features was an investment in the lives of others.</p>

<p>Now I understand that I stayed because somehow breathing in the dusty air of this dingy office made me walk lighter. I felt like a better person, and I didn’t want to give that up. I have the rest of my life to dedicate myself to medicine, but this was my chance to be a journalist. And if I’m any good at being a doctor in the years to come, I know it’s in part because I stopped to smell the newspapers.</p>

<p>The truth is, the Daily Bruin has always been just as much for us as it is for our readers, and that’s because we leave a trace of ourselves in every line of copy. Looking back, I see myself most clearly in my first sentences, known in the newsroom as ledes.</p>

<p>Read me the first sentence of any feature I’ve written, and my reporting experience will rush back. I may never have another byline, but I’ll remember my favorite stories and my time at The Bruin by the ledes I’ve written.</p>

<p>Sometimes it’s the weather that stands out in my memory: It was a sunny Friday as I rushed down to the Kinross Building South, sweating, to write my first story as Science and Health editor on book preservation. I thought of the lede as I passed by the medical center on the way back up to the apartments.</p>

<p>Other times it’s the distractions I remember the most: When I wrote my geocaching story I was sitting on the floor of my Rieber Hall dorm. Students were playing catch in the hallway, and I had a midterm the next day. My idea for the lede came from looking at my “Goonies” poster. It’s still the most effortless story I’ve written.</p>

<p>Ironically, though, my favorite lede was never published: “In the small, white wooden courthouse cornfields away from the bloodiest battles of the war, the soiled blue wool uniform met the fresh cotton gray to bring a country together again.”</p>

<p>Scrawled in a reporter’s notebook more than two years ago during a writing workshop, it describes, with creative license, the surrender of Robert E. Lee to Ulysses S. Grant on April 9, 1865.</p>

<p>I saved it for the reenactment story I swore I would one day write.</p>

<p>Two and a half years later and still no story, but even unpublished ledes carry nostalgia. And that’s good enough for me.</p>

<p>Now I’ve run out of time, and there are no ledes left for me to write.</p>

<p>All there is to say is that when I walked through the double doors of the Daily Bruin four years ago asking for the campus tours, I never thought Kerckhoff Hall would come to mean so much to me.</p>

<p>My experience at the university, it seems, started where it would one day end – in the windowless office between North and South Campus where my competing interests found a way to complement each other.</p>

<p>For all the ledes I wrote and read in between, I’m grateful.</p>
