<p>A place is an important thing.</p>

<p>There are many marvelous places in the world. But one of my favorites (perhaps my most favorite) is UCLA’s campus. It’s been my very best friend during my time here, and I can say with certainty that some of the most beautiful places I’ve experienced have been scattered throughout campus.</p>

<p>The Botanical Gardens has seen more of my smiles, my tears and my dance moves than many of my friends.</p>

<p>South Campus gave me a safe space to get away from the brick and pretensions of the collegiate North. The roof of Terasaki was a critical site of development for me as a person, and I’ve lived out my romantic sci-fi fantasies while walking in the field behind the Center for Health Sciences.</p>

<p>I’ve taken countless naps on the fourth-floor couch of the law school tower. Bunche Hall has hugged me when I was down and high-fived me when I was up.</p>

<p>The parking garages helped me stay out of the rain (and gave me a space to sing out loud during my walks home).</p>

<p>Molecular Sciences transported me across the country and showed me my own private gallery of photos.</p>

<p>The tree behind the chancellor’s house always held me up when I wanted to be around plants.</p>

<p>And the Anderson patio allowed me to enjoy my lunches while pretending I owned a giant, fantastic villa.</p>

<p>UCLA obviously has many beautiful landmarks. Royce Hall stands as a beacon of our campus’ magnificence, and the sculpture garden has received recognition from Playboy for its allure. But in my exploration of UCLA, I’ve found many, many spots that are just as beautiful and just as much a part of this university as the more visible buildings and hangouts.</p>

<p>A serious investigation into the wonderful world contained within our 419 acres has given me too many pleasures to count and has supported me in ways that no heart-to-heart could. Disappearing into the dirty stairwell underneath Lakretz gave me breathing room, and the jogging path along Charles E. Young Drive has reminded me daily that things can be really, really good.</p>

<p>I am so grateful to UCLA for giving me such an exciting and meaningful geography to live inside of. I’m thankful for every tree placard, every bridge and every patch of grass. I’ll miss the infinite amount of stairs that come in all shapes, lengths and heights that challenged me on my way to class, and I want to thank the office chairs in basement storage for letting me rest when I needed to.</p>

<p>I will miss going to school here, sure. I’ve liked being a UCLA student. But my heart is heaviest knowing I have to leave this campus.</p>

<p>Please, go out of your way to walk somewhere on campus you haven’t been to before. Go up the side staircase of Public Affairs to the fifth-floor balcony and sit at the tables up there. Climb up on founder’s rock near Murphy Hall.</p>

<p>Your time at UCLA becomes infinitely lovelier the more you get to know its campus.</p>
