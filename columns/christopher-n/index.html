<p>Saying goodbye isn’t one of my strong suits.</p>

<p>I’ve avoided having to say farewell for weeks now despite knowing my inevitable graduation inches closer by the second. At my very last event with Mentorship Program at UCLA, I didn’t have the kids I cherished so much sign a yearbook for me to remember them by. I haven’t delivered my senior will to my fraternity brothers. And I haven’t sent out texts to catch up with friends to reminisce about that one time freshman year.</p>

<p>But I am writing my final column for the Daily Bruin – my first home at UCLA since the fall of my first year – so hopefully this will provide some closure.</p>

<p>As I walk around campus nowadays I can’t help but stop and marvel at its beauty. With my days here numbered, these words incessantly come to mind: “How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard.”</p>

<p>A Bruin said that. Well, kind of. It was Winnie the Pooh, who’s a bear, so that counts in my book.</p>

<p>You would think that after four years of attending one of the most prestigious universities in the world, I’d be mature enough to offer a quote from an academic or a philosopher. Well, UCLA provided me with quite the opposite.</p>

<p>I got a playground.</p>

<p>Curiosity sweeps through campus unbounded as students poke and prod their way to new discoveries. There’s even a jungle gym of tunnels underground – just don’t get caught climbing through it. UCLA allows the imagination to run wild because here, there are no limits – and if there are, as we’ve seen time and time again, a Bruin will break them down.</p>

<p>At the Daily Bruin, some of my best friends and I have stayed up all night telling stories of fear, perseverance and triumph – a sleepover of sorts, a stressful one at times, and in a stuffy, windowless office in Kerckhoff Hall.</p>

<p>And as an elementary school program coordinator for the Mentorship Program, I finally found people at my own maturity level. These kids often envision themselves going to UCLA one day, like I once did at their age and like I still do – I’d do anything to be able to have another four years here.</p>

<p>But as that one dreaded song by Vitamin C begins playing in the background, along with that other insufferable one by Green Day, I’ve come to the realization that this time, I won’t need to learn to say goodbye. I won’t need to say goodbye to friends because I’ve made a family here.</p>

<p>And that makes me feel even luckier to be a Bruin.</p>
